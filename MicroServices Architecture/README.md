> # MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE:

Microservices architecture is a software development approach that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled,highly scalable, independently deployable services.

 Each service focuses on a specific business capability and communicates with others through well-defined APIs.

 Each microservice can be scaled independently based on its load, allowing for efficient resource utilization.

 For instance, a popular product page can be scaled without affecting the entire application.

 By scaling only the necessary components, organizations can optimize costs.

 If one microservice fails, it doesn't bring down the entire application, ensuring continued service availability.

 The system can be designed to handle failures gracefully, improving overall reliability.
 Microservices are very good in handling large, complex applications with multiple functionalities.

 Different microservices can use different technologies and programming languages, allowing for optimal solutions.
